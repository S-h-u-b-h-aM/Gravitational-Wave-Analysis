# Gravitational-Wave-Analysis
This project showcases how to analyze the Gravitational wave data stored at LIGO/VIRGO observatories, using Python programming language.\
The notebooks which are provided can be downloaded but Google colab is highly recommended since the data to be analysed and modules are much larger to be downloaded.\
